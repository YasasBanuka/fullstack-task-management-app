# üìù Full-Stack Task Management App

A modern, responsive task management application built with the Spring Boot and React stack. This project demonstrates a complete full-stack development cycle, from a RESTful API backend to a dynamic, interactive frontend.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-task-management-app.git](https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-task-management-app.git)
    cd fullstack-task-management-app
    ```

2.  **Run the Backend:**
    - Navigate to the backend directory:
      ```sh
      cd task-management
      ```
    - Run the Spring Boot application using Maven:
      ```sh
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```
    - The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **Run the Frontend:**
    - Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:
      ```sh
      cd task-management-ui
      ```
    - Install NPM packages:

## üß† What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into full-stack development and solidified my understanding of:

-   Building and structuring a RESTful API from scratch with Spring Boot.
-   Managing component state and side effects in React using hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
-   Connecting a frontend application to a backend API, including handling CORS issues.
-   Implementing the complete CRUD lifecycle in a real-world application.
-   Debugging common issues between the client and server, such as API contract mismatches.
-   The importance of clean, component-based architecture in React.

## üåü Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization with Spring Security and JWT.
- [ ] Allow users to change the status of tasks (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
- [ ] Replace the H2 database with a persistent database like PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a cloud service like Heroku or AWS.
